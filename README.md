# cSBM_Matching
Graph matching alorithm on correlated SBM

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the graph matching method developed in "Efficient Algorithms for Exact Graph Matching on
Correlated Stochastic Block Models with Constant Correlation"(2023). 

## Overview
* Signature : This folder contains the code to generate signature vector.
* baseline : Baseline algorithm(GRAMPA, Degree Profile) which used on paper.
* construcht_graph : Generate two correlated graph which follows Stochastic Block Model(SBM) 
* second_step : This folder contains Refinement matching and Seeded matching
* SBMExperiment : Comparing our algorithm and baseline.
